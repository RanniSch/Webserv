* The accept system call grabs the first connection request on the queue of pending connections (set up in listen) and creates
* a new socket for that connection. The original socket that was set up for listening is used only for accepting connections,
* not for exchanging data. By default, socket operations are synchronous, or blocking, and accept will block until a connection
* is present on the queue.
*
* int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict address, socklen_t *restrict address_len);
* int socket: is the socket that was set for accepting connections with listen
*   (file descriptor for the new socket, saved in _sock so here getSock() to get the integer).
* address: is the address structure that gets filed in with the address of the client that is doing the connect.
*   This allows us to examine the address and port number of the connecting socket if we want to.
* address_len: filled in with the length of the address structure.
