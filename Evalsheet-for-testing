Guidelines
- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated student or group.

Mandatory Part
Check the code and ask questions
• Ask what function the group used for I/O Multiplexing.
• Ask if they use only one select() (or equivalent) and how they've managed the server to accept and the client to read/write.
• The select() (or equivalent) should be in the main loop and should check file descriptors for read and write AT THE SAME TIME. If not, the grade is 0 and the evaluation process ends now.
• There should be only one read or one write per client per select() (or equivalent). Ask the group to show you the code from the select() (or equivalent) to the read and write of a client.
• Search for all read/recv/write/send on a socket and check that, if an error is returned, the client is removed.
• Search for all read/recv/write/send and check if the returned value is correctly checked (checking only -1 or 0 values is not enough, both should be checked).
• If errno is checked after read/recv/write/send, the grade is 0 and the evaluation process ends now.
• Writing or reading ANY file descriptor without going through the select() (or equivalent) is strictly FORBIDDEN.
• If any point is unclear or is not correct, the evaluation stops.

Configuration
In the configuration file, check whether you can do the following and test the result:
• Setup multiple servers with different hostnames (use something like: curl --resolve example.com:80:127.0.0.1 http://example.com/ (http://example.com/)).
• Limit the client body (use: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: plain/text" --data "BODY IS HERE write something shorter or longer than body limit").

Port issues
• Launch multiple servers at the same time with different configurations but with common ports. Does it work? If it does, ask why the server should work if one of the configurations isn't functional. Keep going.

Siege & stress test
• Verify there is no memory leak (Monitor the process memory usage. It should not go up indefinitely).
• Check if there is no hanging connection.
